                <h4>About Us</h4>
                Built by three Northeastern students, primarily during HuskyHacks v2.0 (2016). The initial intent was for it
                to accompany an article published by <a href="https://www.huntnewsnu.com" target="_blank">The Huntington News</a>
                on the recent increase in reported incidents on NEU's campus (seen <a href="http://huntnewsnu.com/2016/10/annual-document-shows-increase-in-reported-incidents/" target="_blank">here</a>)
                , but we realized it had far more potential than simply displaying data from a few schools in the Boston area.
                By upgrading our dataset to include over 11,000 schools across the country, users can compare reported crime
                data between a much larger breadth of schools.
                <br><br>
                As we mentioned in the "Overview" section, this data is sourced from the U.S. Department of Labor, and is still
                in the process of being cleaned up. With so many schools, it's very difficult for us to validate the data
                against the official documents released by the universities. In a perfect world, everything should line up,
                but we can't guarantee the accuracy of all the data our graph displays just yet.
                <br><br>
                Interested in how this was built? Check out the gihub repo linked at the bottom of this card! We built this
                on a MEAN tech stack, utilized mLab for hosting our database, ChartJS's javascript graphing library to
                visualize our data, and Heroku to host the app itself.
