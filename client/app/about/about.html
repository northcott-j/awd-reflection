                <h4>About The Project</h4>
                <h3>Welcome to my multimodal Advanced Writing reflection!</h3>
                If you head on over to the main tab (<a href=”http://awd.jdnorthcott.com/”>Home Page</a>), you should
                see all of the learning goals in grey boxes. If you click one, a bunch of resources will load to help
                you complete that goal. The Unit papers provide plenty of opportunities to meet - or exceed - the
                learning goals. The challenge is doing it write (lol). <br><br>
                The second tab of this website is designed to inspire you (<a href=”http://awd.jdnorthcott.com/rss”>RSS
                Inspiration</a>). With every click of the shuffle button, 30 new news articles will appear. Those are
                updated live and will be new each time and each day. They’re sourced from about 21 different RSS feeds
                from several news sources. Feel free to checkout the README in the source code to see the exact
                links.<br><br>
                This is similar to the process that I used to work through my Unit papers, and I survived the class
                (knock on wood). Good luck with your semester!
